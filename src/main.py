# pylint: disable=fixme

# IMPORTANT FEATURES THAT SHOULD BE DONE FIRST
# TODO: Write some game loop so player after dying will get back to menu and can play again without game shutting itself
# TODO: Add a menu when ESC key is pressed with stats like movement speed, damage etc.
# TODO: Replace intro screen with main menu

# FEATURES THAT SHOULD BE ADDED OR CONSIDERED
# TODO: Like sounds make textures loading dynamic based on dictionary access (not necessary for now)
#   And check in function add_texture() if the .convert_alpha() should be done after scaling or before
# TODO: Change that Bullet is not referencing Player and Player bullet, this cross reference is trash
# TODO: Change that texture for anything can be None and ensure it does not make any problem (draw just a casual rect)
# TODO: Add levels
# TODO: Add some special attacks and upgrades through the game as the player is leveling up
# TODO: Add text or particles when player has a buff
# TODO: FPS meter in right top corner that can be disabled or turned on in settings (clock.get_fps())
# TODO: Should merge all enums in one enum file?
# TODO: Standardize drawing, sometimes it is done by the instance itself,
#  sometimes by class that handles all instances...
# TODO: Rewrite waves and bosses
# TODO: Add some sort of currency (temporary, permanent for upgrades)
# TODO: Add some permanent upgrades for currency
# TODO: Create function update() that will handle ALL the calls like drawing, moving etc. or make some sub-funcs that
#   some will handle draw, some move etc. that's up to you in the future to decide
# TODO: Now the game is based on texture size, should be changed to rect size I guess?
# TODO: Do i need to call .set_volume for each sound effect in functions like destroying enemy or picking up a buff?
# TODO: Add a bloom in the future on shoots?

# OPTIMIZATION
# TODO: Optimize the game and try CProfiler to see what takes a lot of time,
#  try to reduce checking every frame to every second frame
# TODO: Optimize to check collision only with enemies on the same y axis as the enemy that is calculating the collision
# TODO: Maybe add some kind of parallelism or multithreading in the future?
